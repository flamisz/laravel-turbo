[turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)

[stimulusjs](https://stimulusjs.org/)

## The Project

Small project to try out Turbolinks (and StimulusJs) with Laravel and compare the user experience with and without it. The different versions of the app are on different branches.

Branches:
[develop-base](https://github.com/flamisz/laravel-turbo/tree/develop-base)

[develop-with-turbo](https://github.com/flamisz/laravel-turbo/tree/develop-with-turbo)

The running apps:
[Nojs Version](https://laravel-turbo.herokuapp.com)

[Turbolinks Version](https://laravel-turbo-2.herokuapp.com)

StimulusJs: coming soon...

## The App

User can create tasks and tracking times (start and stop time).

The different versions off the apps are sharing the DB.

Test user: `test@test.com` / `password`

The apps are running on free Heroku dyno (they need time to wake up at first load).
